If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Create an array based off the value of the given number
if the number is divisible by 3 push to array, same for 5
sum the array

let arr = [];
let sum = 0;

for(let i = 0; i <= 1000; i++){
if(i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0 ) {
sum += i
}
}
return sum;

function returnSum() {
let sum = 0;
for(let i = 0; i < 1000; i++){
if(i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0 ) {
sum += i;
}
}
return sum;
}

//

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

for (i = 0; i <= param; i++){
}

//param is 400000000
returnEvenNumberFibonacciSum(param) {
let sum = 2;
//add
let fibonacciSequence = [0,1,2];

for (i = 2; i <= param; i++){
let NextNum = (fibonacciSequence[i-1]) + fibonacciSequence[i];
fibonacciSequence.push(NextNum);

    if((fibonacciSequence[i+1] != null) && (fibonacciSequence[i+1] % 2 === 0)) {
      sum += fibonacciSequence[i+1];
    }

}
return sum;
}

    // for (j= 0; j <= fibonacciSequence.length; j++)
      if(fibonacciSequence[j] % 2 === 0)
        sum += fibonacciSequence[j];



function returnEvenNumberFibonacciSum(param) {
let sum = 2;
let fibonacciSequence = [0,1,2];

for (let i = 2; i <= param; i++){
let NextNum = (fibonacciSequence[i-1] + fibonacciSequence[i]);
fibonacciSequence.push(NextNum);
console.log("next num" + NextNum);
if((fibonacciSequence[i+1] !== null) && (fibonacciSequence[i+1] % 2 == 0)) {
sum += fibonacciSequence[i+1];
console.log("sum" + sum);
}
}
return sum;
}

let i = 2;
while (sum <= param){
let NextNum = (fibonacciSequence[i-1] + fibonacciSequence[i]);
fibonacciSequence.push(NextNum);
console.log("next num" + NextNum);
if((fibonacciSequence[i+1] !== null) && (fibonacciSequence[i+1] % 2 == 0)) {
sum += fibonacciSequence[i+1];
console.log("sum" + sum);
}
i++;
}
return sum;
}

alert(returnEvenNumberFibonacciSum(10));
